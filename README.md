# Beautiful-Days-at-the-Movies
This C# program counts “beautiful days” within a range. The `beautifulDays` function iterates from `i` to `j`, reverses each day’s number, and checks if the absolute difference between the day and its reverse is divisible by `k`. It returns the total count of such days. The `Main` method reads the range and divisor, calls the function, and outputs the result.
